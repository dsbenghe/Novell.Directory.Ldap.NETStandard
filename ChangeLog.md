### 2.3.0 Initial version built against the release version of .NET Core 1.0. The main changes for porting were around:
* Thread usage: the library was extensively using Abort, Interrupt, ThreadInterruptedException, ... - which is not recommended and also not supported in .NET Core.
* Serialization support for a limited number of types was deleted; not supported on .net core
* Ssl support: the library was using Mono.Security for this. Now is implemented using SslStream from NetStandard
* Implement IDisposable for LdapConnection to allow usage of "using" construct
